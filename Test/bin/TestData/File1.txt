TEST TASK
for getting remote Delphi developer job

Estimated completion time: 1.5 hours

---

You are about to create a Win32 app using Delphi 2010 called TarFTP.
It contains one window with a list box. User can drag&drop files to
this list from Windows Explorer and their names will be added to the
list. There is "Upload" button under the list. When user clicks that
button the application will package those files into one tar archive
and upload it to FTP server.

All heavy processing (archiving and uploading) should perform in
background thread. User should see appropriate UI feedback, e.g.
progress bar with speed and elapsed time.

This description specifies only core concept. If you are unsure about
something - you are free to do as you wish, your main aim is to make
simple and good software.
